    # Top 10 ATS Tips for South African Job Seekers

    In today's competitive South African job market, getting your CV past Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) is crucial. These automated systems scan and filter applications before a human ever sees them. Here are our top 10 tips to ensure your CV makes it through:

    ## 1. Use Standard CV Sections
    
    Include clearly labeled sections like "Work Experience," "Education," and "Skills." ATS systems are programmed to look for these standard headings.

    ## 2. Incorporate Relevant Keywords
    
    Review the job description carefully and include relevant keywords throughout your CV. For example, if applying for an accounting position, include terms like "financial reporting," "IFRS," and "tax compliance."

    ## 3. Avoid Tables and Graphics
    
    Many ATS systems struggle to read information contained in tables, graphics, or text boxes. Stick to simple formatting with clear sections.

    ## 4. Use a Professional File Name
    
    Name your file professionally, like "Name_Surname_CV.pdf" rather than "CV_Final_Final_2.pdf."

    ## 5. Choose the Right File Format
    
    Submit your CV as a .docx or .pdf file unless otherwise specified. These formats are most ATS-friendly.

    ## 6. Include Your Location
    
    Specify your city and province. Many South African employers filter candidates by location, especially when considering transport logistics.

    ## 7. Quantify Achievements
    
    Use numbers and percentages to highlight achievements. Instead of "Increased sales," write "Increased sales by 35% over 6 months."

    ## 8. Spell Out Abbreviations
    
    Include both the abbreviation and the full term, e.g., "Bachelor of Commerce (BCom)," especially for industry-specific qualifications.

    ## 9. List Previous Companies Clearly
    
    Include the full name of previous employers. Some ATS systems match candidates who have worked for specific organizations.

    ## 10. Customize for Each Application
    
    Tailor your CV for each role you apply for, adjusting keywords and highlighting relevant experience based on the specific job description.

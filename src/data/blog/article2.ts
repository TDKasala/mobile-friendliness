    # What South African Recruiters Look For in CVs in 2025

    Understanding what recruiters are looking for can significantly increase your chances of landing an interview. We spoke with hiring managers across South Africa to identify the most important elements they look for when reviewing CVs.

    ## Clear Demonstration of Skills

    Recruiters want to see specific skills relevant to the position. Rather than listing generic skills, provide concrete examples of how you've applied them in previous roles.

    ## B-BBEE Status

    Many South African companies have transformation targets. If applicable, include your B-BBEE status clearly but not prominently - it should be visible but not the focus of your application.

    ## Local Market Knowledge

    For positions in industries like retail, finance, and marketing, demonstrating understanding of the South African market is crucial. Highlight experience with local market conditions where relevant.

    ## Language Proficiency

    South Africa has 11 official languages, and language skills can be a significant advantage. Be honest about your proficiency levels in different languages, especially if the job involves customer interaction.

    ## Educational Context

    Include both your qualifications and the institutions you attended. Many recruiters are familiar with different South African universities and their reputations in various fields.

    ## Adaptability and Resilience

    Given South Africa's dynamic business environment, recruiters value candidates who can demonstrate adaptability. Include examples of how you've navigated change or overcome challenges.

    ## Digital Literacy

    As remote work becomes more common, digital literacy is essential. Highlight your experience with relevant software and digital tools.

    ## Quantifiable Achievements

    Numbers speak volumes. Quantify your achievements where possible with percentages, amounts, or other measurable outcomes.

    ## Consistent Employment History

    Be prepared to explain any gaps in your employment history. South African recruiters understand the challenging job market but appreciate honesty about periods of unemployment.

    ## Cultural Fit

    Many South African companies place high value on cultural fit. Without compromising the professional nature of your CV, find ways to convey your values and working style.
